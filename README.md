# T1REQUIRE
T1 REtrospective Quantification Using Internal REferences -- Convert T1 weighted MR images to T1 maps

# Introduction
The purpose of this code is to use healthy tissues as references for conversion of T1 weighted images into T1 maps. By using either a derived signal equation or simulated signal intensity along with reference values of T1 and/or T2 from the literature, it seems possible to retrospectively estimate T1 from these T1 weighted images. Currently, this code is only optimized for neuroimaging, but may be able to be extended to further imaging locations in the future. The paper for this project is currently under review and will be updated when completed. Any work using this method must cite this paper!

# Getting Started
This code was built in MATLAB v2016b. It should be compatible with later versions of MATLAB as well. To run this code, it requires SPM12 (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) installed.
